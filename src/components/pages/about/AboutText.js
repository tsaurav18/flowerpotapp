        <h3>ABOUT GREEN QUEEN FABRIC POTS</h3>
        <p className="text">
          Made from recycled plastic bottles otherwise destined for landfills,
          comes a light weight, breathable fabric that is crafted into plant
          pots you can use in your garden, yard or home! These fabric pots are
          wonderful for plants—roots can cool in summer, and not suffocate from
          over-watering. The fabric material lets water permeate so there’s
          sufficient drainage without holes in the pot. Plus, they’re washable
          and reusable and will decompose if planted into the ground. A great
          quality fabric aeration container combined with premium organic
          nutrients, plenty of light and ample ventilation are the key
          components to achieving some of the largest yields in history.
          Side-by-side tests in fabric aeration containers versus plastic pots
          prove noticeable differences in plant quality and yield size. Our
          Green Queen Grow Bags can be used to grow plants of any size and type,
          and is also ideal for transporting plants because they are
          lightweight, durable with the larger sizes coming with carrying
          handles. Potted plants and trees will enjoy healthy growth while
          above-ground, and can also be planted directly in the ground, where
          the pot will degrade to allow the roots to take hold in the natural
          environment . We have several sizes of bags, designed to suit specific
          crops. You’ll use only as much soil as you need, and enjoy the maximum
          harvest in the minimum space. With fabric containers, the
          possibilities are virtually limitless! They have made it possible to
          grow your own food on balconies, porches, decks and vertical walls.
          Try some fabric bags into your garden and see for yourself just how
          impressive the results can be!

                Fabric pots were originally designed as an alternative to hard
                plastic, ceramic, or clay pots. The first industry to use them
                were large nurseries growing trees. They needed a healthy and
                lightweight solution to protect what they were going to sell.
                Now fabric pots are being chosen by nurseries, farms, and
                backyards everywhere.
